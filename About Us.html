<p class="No"> Our website is a non profitable website that helps educate people on how unhealthy some fast foods may be, the fast food chains we currently provice are Mcdonalds and Kfc. These fast food cgains are very popular and get millions of sales every day worldwide. <br> Our Goal is to help stop people from buying fast food often and start eating healthier. Now, we aren't trying to make people stop eating from fast food chains but we want to help make them stop eating it as much so that they don't gain weight or have future health problems. A main issue we have in our every day lives is how accessible our fast food chains are for people, if its heading to work or just going out somewhere, there will always be a fast food chain near them. Our website wants to inform people on how unhealthy the things they may buy from these fast foods and help them cut back on the urge to buy from fast food places or even quit it forever. We hope to make a difference on our earth and help prevent diabetes which is a possible outcome from eating from fast food chains to often.
If you have any further questions, contact our email or give them us a call. We have a page dedicated to giving you our information in case of any furhter questions.</p>
